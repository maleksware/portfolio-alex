--- My name is Aleksander Maksimov, I'm 15 years old.<br/>
I am a competitive programmer and a soccer player.<br/>
I study in [Gymnasium 1505](http://gym1505.ru/) in Moscow with advanced courses in English, Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science.

# School

I am currently in **9th grade** in [Russian school system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Russia#Levels_of_education) and have two more full years till graduation.

I find myself pretty easy to teach and I'm always glad to learn something new.

I'm always interested in productive learning combined with comfortable and collaborative atmosphere.
Besides education I enjoy playing team sports and participate in competitions and olympiads.

### School performance and grades:

Our school uses [Russian 5-mark system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Russia) where 5 denotes "excellent" (A in Australian system).

I have **top marks** in **all subjects** after each term in **all 8 completed years** of school.
Here are final year grades for the last seven years:

# Competitive programming

For the last 2 years I was practicing competitive programming. According to [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/hurricanecoder?locale=en), I am currently in top-500 Moscow.

Of programming languages I prefer Python and C++. I can teach others Scratch and LEGO Mindstorms, including advanced algorithms.

I am familiar with many microcontrollers, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I've made a local system tesing server using Fedora OS.

I have some another cool projects written in Python, some of them are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maleksware).

### Programming awards and diplomas:

In the summer of 2022 I have been selected to 4 different summer school courses of olympiad programming, each one with entry exam:

- [Ministry of Education camp for competitive programming](https://inf.mosolymp.ru/)
- [MIPT University summer camp](https://it-edu.com/mipt-school/)
- [NlogN camp](https://nlogn.info/camp)
- [SIS (Summer Informatics School)](https://lksh.ru/)

I successfully completed all these schools with excellent and good marks.
